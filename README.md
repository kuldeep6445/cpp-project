Sudoku is a puzzle game designed for a single player, much like a crossword puzzle. 
The puzzle itself is nothing more than a grid of little boxes called “cells”.
The rule of game is that each row must have digits 1 to 9 and every digit must occur once in that row.
Same rule is for each column and each 3X3 box.
